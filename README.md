# Description
This code is for the paper "Forced Exploration in Bandit Problems".

This code is adapted from https://github.com/YRussac/LB-SDA.

To test the stationary settings, just run "test_stationary.py"

To test the non-stationary settings, run "test_non_sta.py"

When testing on two different distributions, remember to modify the SW-TS parameter configuration in param.py

Our code is Bernoulli by default, and to test the Gaussian distribution, just need to change the function generate_arm_Beronoulli to generate_arm_Gauss.
